# Loan Approval Prediction System

## Overview

Predicts loan approval likelihood using a [Specify Model, e.g., Logistic Regression] model trained on historical data. Assists financial institutions in decision-making via user input and approval/rejection prediction.

## Features

* Predicts loan approval status (Approved/Not Approved).
* User-friendly 
* Clear prediction output.

## Technologies

* Python
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn ([Specify Model])
* matplotlib (if used)
* seaborn (if used)
* mlxtend (if used)
* imbalanced-learn (if used)
* joblib
* Flask (if web app)
* HTML (if web app)
* CSS (if web app)

## Setup

1.  Clone repo 
2.  Create virtual environment (recommended).
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4.  [Web App:] Run `python app.py`. Access via browser.
1.  Clone repo ().

## Data

Trained on features like: Education, Self-Employment, Income, Loan Amount, Civil Score, Asset Values. Target: Loan Approval (1/0).

## Model Training

1.  Data load & preprocess.
2.  Feature selection.
3.  Handle imbalance (if used).
4.  Model training.
5.  Evaluation .
6.  Model saved (`joblib`).

## Usage

1.  Open web interface.
2.  Enter applicant details.
3.  Click "Predict".
